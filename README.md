# hrnet-react 🚀

## Project Description 📋

This project was created as part of the Front-end JavaScript React Developer training program at OpenClassrooms.

Participate in converting an application to React. You will transform a jQuery plugin from the site into React.

### Evaluated Skills 🛠️

- Analyze the performance of a web application 📈
- Deploy a front-end application 🚀
- Program in JavaScript with functional programming 🤖
- Refactor an application to reduce technical debt 🛠️

### Project Situation (Fictional) 🏢

Developer within the technology department of a large financial company.

This company uses an internal web application that manages employee records. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end, leading to significant bugs and an increase in internal complaints.

My role was to upgrade the application using React, convert one of the four jQuery plugins used by the application into a React library, publish this library on GitHub and npmjs.com, and provide performance comparisons.

### Specifications 📜

- Convert the entire project to React.
- Create a new version of the "Create Employee" and "Employee List" pages with React.
- Add a state management system.
- Ensure consistency in style. A more modern design is welcome.
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins into a React library. Replace the remaining three jQuery plugins with React components in the application.
- Only convert the code that deals with the actual functionality (The conversion should not be an exact one-to-one translation).
- Publish the converted plugin as a React library on GitHub or npmjs.com.
- Perform Lighthouse performance tests comparing the old and new applications.
